# My Current Resume

## What is this?
This repository contains the source code to the PDF versions of my personal work
resumes.  They are written in the TeX markup language for the legendary
typesetting engine, [LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX
"Wikipedia page"). I am using a wonderful template from
[LaTeXTemplates.com](http://latextemplates.com).

If you do not have LaTeX installed, I have compiled PDF versions in this repo
and upon request via email.

I also have a rudimentary `.doc` and `.docx` versions I can send via email
upon request.

## Versions

I am interested in applying for programming and UNIX/Linux/Mac/Windows system
administration positions.  As such I have written two resumes, one for each type
of position:
- *`amr-resume-sysadmin.tex`:* for system administration positions
- *`amr-resume-developer.tex`:* for software development positions
- *`amr-resume-devops.tex`:* for DevOps positions.

## Compiling
If you have LaTeX installed, all you have to run is:

	pdflatex amr-resume-sysadmin.tex

Replace `sysadmin` with the desired version of the resume you want to compile.

## Enjoying
Then simply open the generated `amr-resume-sysadmin.pdf` file with your
favorite PDF reader.

I like [MuPDF](http://mupdf.com/ "MuPDF home page"), but you can use Acrobat
if you *really* want to.
