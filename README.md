# My Current Resume

## What is this?
This repository contains the source code to the PDF versions of my personal work
resumes.  They are written in the TeX markup language for the legendary
typesetting engine, [LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX
"Wikipedia page"). I am using a wonderful template from
[LaTeXTemplates.com](http://latextemplates.com).

If you do not have LaTeX installed, I have compiled PDF versions in this repo
and upon request via email.

I also have a rudimentary `.doc` and `.docx` versions I can send via email
upon request.

## Compiling
If you have LaTeX installed, all you have to run is:

	pdflatex amr-resume-sysadmin.tex

## Enjoying
To view the generated PDF, simply open the generated `amr-resume-sysadmin.pdf`
file in your favorite PDF reader.  I like
[MuPDF](http://mupdf.com/ "MuPDF home page"), but you can use Acrobat
if you *really* want to.
